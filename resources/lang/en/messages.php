Most importantly, the mechanism is <b>strategyproof</b>, meaning that it is a weakly dominant strategy to submit your true preferences. In other words, you do not have to worry about whether you should rank a very popular seminar first or not. If a particular seminar is your top favourite, you can safely rank it first without harming your chances of admission to any of your other choices. <br><br> Second, the mechanism produces a <b>fair allocation</b> by taking into account the preferences of students and seminar organizers. This means that if you are not admitted to your top choice, all other students who are admitted to that seminar had a higher priority than yours. <br><br> Third, we make sure that students who plan to attend two seminars A and B in combination can only do so if there is no other student who would be willing to attend these two seminars separately. This is to ensure that <b>as many students as possible</b> can attend at least one seminar.',

  <b>Example</b>
  If you are interested in taking the seminar in Game Theory together with either the seminar in Finance or E-commerce you should add the combinations

<li> Seminar 1: Game Theory <i>and</i> Seminar 2: Finance </li>
<li> Seminar 1: Game Theory <i>and</i> Semianr 2: E-commerce </li>

</ul>
to the list. By default, we will also add to the list all seminars that are part of a combination. E.g., in the above example, Game Theory, Finance and E-commerce would all be added to your list of consideration as single seminars. If you are not interested in taking any of these single seminars on their own, you can delete them in the step below. <b>You should only delete these courses if you would prefer to not attend any seminar rather than attending such a single seminar on its own.</b>
