# Kursmatch - Seminar Allocation Tool

**Kursmatch** is a web application for allocation of university seminars by the roth pearson algorithm.
The project is in action at the University of Mannheim for the spring semester 2019, Germany. This repository currently consists of a snapshot of the implementation in Mannheim.

## Introduction

The application uses a version of the well-known Gale-Shapley algorithm to allocate you, the students, to available seminar capacities. For more information on the algorithm, read the Wikipedia articles on the [stable marriage problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) and on the application of this algorithm to the allocation of graduates from [medical school to hospitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program#Matching_algorithm) in the U.S.

It consists of a specific survey (preference language) to retrieve applicants preferences over couple combinations, e.g. two seminars/courses at a time.
